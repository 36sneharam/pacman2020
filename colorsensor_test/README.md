# Printing the RGB value detected by the color sensor 

## The wiring
Wire it the following wiring: 
* Vcc to 5V 
* S0 to 5 
* S1 to 4 
* S3 to 6 
* S2 to 7 
* OUT to 8 

## Run the arduino code (cs_printcolor.inu) 
Upload cs_printcolor.inu and open up the serial monitor from the Tool menu. You should see the RGB value detected from the sensor. Note that this value is not calibrated and could be wildly different from the real RGB value.
