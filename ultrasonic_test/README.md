# Installing HCSR04 Library 
The ultrasonic sensor your are given is the HCSR04 sensor. The easiest way to read out the information from the sensor is to install the HCSR04 Library (this is one of many libraries you can find on arduino)

The library you will be installing is this: https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/hcsr04

To install libraries on Arduino, go to the Tools menu and click Manage Libraries. A new window should pop up with a list of libraries. In the search menu, type *HCSR04* and however over the library created by Martin Sosic. Click install and that should be it. 

# Programs to test the sensor 
Here are some pieces of code and wiring instructions to help you get started with using the ultrasonic sensor.
